Start the app

Run `docker-compose up` and `run npm run dev` or `npm run build` in the running application container.

Or if you are using Laravel Sail then run 
`./vendor/bin/sail up` and then `./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev` or `./vendor/bin/sail npm run build`.

After that you can reach the application on `http://localhost:3000/`
